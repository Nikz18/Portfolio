## Project Title: Analysis of Diabetes Risk Factors and Medical Insurance Charges

**Abstract:**

This research analyzes the Diabetes Health Indicator Data and the Medical Cost Personal Dataset to identify diabetes risk factors and understand determinants influencing medical costs. By utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and classification models (logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees), the project aims to enhance preventive healthcare strategies and facilitate cost-effective healthcare management. Key findings reveal significant predictors of diabetes and medical charges, emphasizing the need for informed financial decisions and preventive measures in healthcare.

**Methodology:**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation and variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis to identify key variables.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** PCA and hierarchical clustering to uncover patterns in health indicators and lifestyle factors related to diabetes risk.
- **Supervised Learning:** Classification models (logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees) to assess predictive capabilities, along with regression analysis to identify determinants of medical insurance charges.
  
**Key Findings:**

- **Diabetes Risk Factors:** Significant correlations were found between diabetes occurrence and health factors such as BMI, high blood pressure, and general health.
- **Model Performance:** Logistic regression and random forest models achieved an accuracy of 0.84, though no single factor was sufficient for precise diabetes prediction.
- **Medical Insurance Charges:** Age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children were identified as significant determinants of medical charges, with random forest regression demonstrating superior predictive accuracy.
  
**Conclusion:**

The analysis underscores the critical importance of preventive healthcare measures and informed financial decision-making to address diabetes prevalence and healthcare costs. By integrating insights from data analysis, stakeholders can optimize healthcare policies and interventions to promote individual well-being and mitigate expenses.

**Tools Used:** Python, ScikitLearn(PCA, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression), Matplotlib for data visualization.
